## Description:

- The assignment was to choose our own API and create an app based on the kind of data the API delivers. I decided on a Star Wars API and made a character directory.

- Using React components, the DOM updates dynamically without having to refresh the browser. Users can move forwards or backwards to change character lists and open a profile by clicking on a character name.

- JavaScript - https://www.javascript.com/
