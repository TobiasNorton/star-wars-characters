## Description:

- The assignment was to choose our own API and create an app based on the kind of data the API delivered. I chose a Star Wars API and decided on making a character directory.

- Using React components, the DOM updates dynamically without having to refresh the browser. Users can move forwards or backwards to change character lists and open a profile by clicking on a character name.

- Built with JavaScript, React.js and CSS
